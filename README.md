# Natural-Gas-Storage-Contract-Valuation-Price-Curve-Modeling
Built a Python prototype to model natural gas price curves and value storage contracts, accounting for injection, withdrawal, storage costs, and seasonal trends.

## Project Summary
This project forecasts natural gas prices for any date using historical monthly data and interpolated daily values. It identifies seasonal trends, visualizes monthly patterns, and applies an ARIMA model to predict prices from September 2024 to September 2025, supporting storage contract pricing and trading desk decisions.
